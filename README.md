Audio-Research

written with PyAudio: http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/

This program is written as a cross platform python script that compares the
pitch of a note sung at it to a WAV file and plays back a modified version of
the file to them. The modification will depend upon the pitch of the user's
note.  

This program will record the note and will also record the results of said note    

Main.py
    Main module of the program. Usage at this time is to run it in the same
    directory/folder of the WAV files you wish to compare it to. 

test.py
    the test program that PyAudio recommends you use. This is stub code for the
    main program.

License
    This is under GPL, so anyone can take and modify at as they will. It will
    be specifically written for a single study of course.
